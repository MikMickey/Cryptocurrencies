Module 18 ~ Challenge

## Resources
Data Source: crypto_data.csv from CryptoCompare
Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Analysis Overview
This project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze the database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features

The analysis was conducted in four main steps:  
-   preprocessing the database,
-   reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
-   clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
-   visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
